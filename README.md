Pseudo Proxy
============

This website works effectively as a Proxy, serving as an intermediary between a user and the server of any given website. This "Pseudo Proxy" can be utilized without the download of a proxy client.

To install:

Upload index.php to the root folder of a web server that supports php -- we recommend XAMPP! 

To use:

Navigate to the home page of the web server, then add to the end of the URL a "?", followed by the URL of the website you wish to visit.
